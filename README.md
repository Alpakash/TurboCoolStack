  Multi-Platform App Development Kick-Start powered by Turborepo
</h2>

**TurboCoolStack** üöÄ provides a solid starting point for building applications across different platforms, integrating Turborepo, Electron, React (CRA, Next.js), React Native (Expo) and Tailwind CSS for a streamlined development process. This setup is engineered for those looking to efficiently develop desktop, web and mobile applications with a consistent quality and streamlined workflow.

## üìÅ Workspaces Overview

- **app/docs**: A web app based on Create React App with Tailwind CSS.
- **app/electronRenderer**: Utilizes Create React App with Tailwind CSS, for the Electron renderer process and desktop app UI development.
- **app/electronMain**: Handles Electron's main process, managed by Webpack, responsible for core OS-level interactions.
- **app/electronBuilder**: Oversees the application packaging stage with Electron Builder, It's tasked with compiling and assembling the final desktop application.
- **app/native**: A React Native app based on Expo with Nativewind CSS.
- **app/web**: A web app grounded on Next.js with Tailwind CSS.
- **packages/ui**: This workspace serves as a central repository for UI components, styled with Tailwind CSS.

## üîß Setup & Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Execute `yarn install` in the root directory to fetch all dependencies.

> üìù I suggest using Yarn for consistency and efficiency in the development process, though NPM remains an alternative.

## üöÄ Usage

With the dependencies in place, you can dive into development:

- Run `yarn dev` in the root directory to launch the project in development mode, complete with hot reloading for real-time updates.
- Run `yarn build` in the root directory when you're ready to compile a production-ready package of your application.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è A basic understanding of React, TurboRepo, Next.js, Expo and Electron will enhance your development experience.
